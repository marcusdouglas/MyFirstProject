<h1>How the Right has taken over the Left</h1>

<p id = "p1">For me the right is good for nothing except war, social inequality and an economy of the rich white man. As
    a socialist it is scary to think that the majority of people in this country voted for the conservatives at the gene
    ral election, especially when at least 95% of my friends and my family friends did not. Since Thatcher first made he
    r speech on the steps of number 10 in May 1979, Britain has been a state of complete capitalism. When labour decide
    d that election victory was more important than principles and values upon the election of Tony Blair as leader, the
    poor people of this country lost all hope. Mrs Thatcher still dominates the land we live in, so it’s no surprise that
    in the days after her death thousands of miners and other labourers took to the streets to join them. To be honest if
    I had more political awareness two years ago, I could have been one of them.
    So when Jeremy Corbyn was elected in September, I and million of others felt a sense of hope. Here was a man who would
    finally bring labour back to what it should be, a party of the working people. There isn’t a policy I don’t agree with,
    a stunt I haven’t been proud of. As a supporter of the SNP I even considered returning to labour, that however, lasted
    all of 10 minutes. By the time his victory speech had ended, two of the shadow cabinet had resigned, and by the end of
    the day that figure had reached seven. What a great way to show your support to a leader elected on 60% of the vote.
    In the recent debate on military intervention in Syria the government was able to win a majority of support thanks to
    the support of up to 50 labour MPs.<br>
